---What is programming?


Programming is an exercise or practice that boost our logical thinking and improves a problem-solving skill. It teaches us how to accomplish a task with the help of a computer program or software. Therefore, in simple terms, programming is a task to implement a solution to a problem in the form of computer language. In this section, we will discuss the word programming, programming languages, its type, advantages, disadvantages, and their uses.


---Definition of Programming--


In computer science fields, the word program characterizes what a computer actually does and this process is known as programming.

We can also define the term programming as it is the process that models or structure the set of instructions that instruct the machine how to perform a task and what to perform. It can be done using a variety of programming languages such as
 -C 
-c++
-python
- Java
, etc.

--Advantages of Programming--

-It enhances problem-solving skills.
-Using programming, we can solve complex problems.
-It is also learning with fun.
-It can perform multiple tasks can be bundled into one module.
-It saves time and effort.
-Disadvantages of Programming
-Knowledge of computer is mandatory.
-Logical thinking should be strong.
-Programming Paradigms
-In layman's terms, programming paradigms are a fundamental style of computer programming.



In technical terms, a programming paradigm is a way to deal with tackle issues utilizing some programming language. Additionally, we can say that it is a strategy to take care of an issue using tools and techniques that are accessible to us following some methodology.

It differs in the concepts and methods that are used to represent the elements (such as objects, variables, functions, and constraints) of a program. And the steps that involve a calculation (like assignations, evaluation, continuations, and data flows). The lowest programming paradigm is machine code.

There are lots of things for programming languages that are known. However, every one of them needs to follow some procedure when they are executed and this approach/methodology is a paradigm.
